//: # Gig Poster 4
//: The following two statements are required to make the playground run. Please do not remove.

/*:
 Each image is exactly 400 pixels wide by 600 pixels tall.
 
 Your goal is to precisely reproduce this image:
 
 ![blur-no-grid](blur-no-grid.png "Blur")
 ![blur-with-grid](blur-with-grid.png "Blur")
 
 By precisely reproducing this image, you will demonstrate your understanding of:
 
 * sequence (order of statements in a program)
 * conditionals (making decisions with ``if`` statements)
 * iteration (use of loops to repeat statements)
 
 You may use the color constants created below to obtain the correct colors.
 
 Remember that you can refer to the [Canvas class documentation](https://www.russellgordon.ca/canvasgraphics/documentation/classes/canvas), as needed.

let canvas = Canvas(width: 400, height: 600)

// COLORS
let lightBlue = Color(hue: 193, saturation: 81, brightness: 84, alpha: 100)
